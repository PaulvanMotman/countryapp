# countryapp

An app I made during the Full Stack Web Development course by New York Code + Design Academy at BSSA, Amsterdam.
- The main app, countryapp.js, uses a module called readjason.js to read json files.
- Within the main app, I loop through the data and detect if there is a match between the terminal command and a counry in the database.
